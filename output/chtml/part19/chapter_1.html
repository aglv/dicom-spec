            <a id="para_94e83255-4c99-4738-ac08-ccb44c088264" shape="rect"></a>This Part of the DICOM Standard defines an interface between two software applications. One application, the Hosting System, provides the second application with data, such as a set of images and related data. The second application, the Hosted Application, analyzes that data, potentially returning the results of that analysis, for example in the form of another set of images and/or structured reports, to the first application. Such an Application Program Interface (API) differs in scope from other portions of the DICOM Standard in that it standardizes the data interchange between software components on the same system, instead of data interchange between different systems. Hosted Application programs written to that standardized interface can 'plug-into' (see <a class="xref" href="chapter_1.html#figure_1-1" title="Figure 1-1. Interface between Hosted Application and Hosting System." shape="rect">Figure 1-1</a>) Hosting Systems. The notion of software add-ons or 'plug-ins' is quite common in the computing world, and has been successfully employed to extend the capabilities of web browsers, media players, graphical
  editors, publishing programs, etc. A Hosting System implementer needs only to create the standardized API once in order to support a wide variety of add-on Hosted Applications.</p>

            <a id="para_219268d5-f16e-45e8-90f7-2b17a6a5e6bf" shape="rect"></a>In the traditional 'plug-in' model, the 'plug-in' is dedicated to a particular host system (e.g., a web browsing program), and might not run under other host systems (e.g., other web browsing programs). PS3.19 defines a standardized API that may be implemented by any Hosting System. A 'plug-in' Hosted Application written to the standardized API would be able to run on any Hosting System that implements that standardized API (see <a class="xref" href="chapter_1.html#figure_1-2" title="Figure 1-2. Illustration of Platform Independence via Hosted Application Architecture." shape="rect">Figure 1-2</a>).</p>
