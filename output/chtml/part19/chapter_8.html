            <a id="para_a4f892aa-ae60-4a96-9bfd-a55ced7cd29c" shape="rect"></a>There are three base interfaces defined in this Part, as shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter_8.html#figure_8-1" title="Figure 8-1. Diagram of the Interface Between the Hosting System and the Hosted Application" shape="rect">Figure 8-1</a>. One, named "Application", represents the Hosted Application, and is utilized by the Hosting System to control the Hosted Application. The second, named "Host", represents the Hosting System, and is utilized by the Hosted Application to request services from and to notify the Hosting System of events during the execution of the Hosted Application. The third, named "DataExchange" is an interface used by both the Hosting System and the Hosted Application to communicate information about the data to be exchanged. Thus, the entire Hosted Application ("ApplicationService") implementation consists of the combination of the "Application" and "DataExchange" base interfaces, while the entire Hosting System ("HostService") implementation consists of the combination of the "Host" and "DataExchange" base interfaces.</p>

            <a id="para_d8541448-2b7e-4d6b-ae33-00bac2ac25dd" shape="rect"></a>The interfaces are defined as a set of methods using Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The implementers shall change the end point references (i.e., the "location" XML Attribute within the "address" XML Element within the "port" XML Elements of a "service" XML Element) in the WSDL specification as needed to deploy Hosted Applications and Hosting Systems that utilize these interfaces.</p>

To maintain backward compatibility, the names of existing elements, messages, and operations in the WSDL specification of the interfaces remain the same.</p>
