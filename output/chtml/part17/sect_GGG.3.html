It is possible that the procedure performed may differ in some details from the procedure scheduled. It is up to the performing system to decide how much the performed procedure can differ from the scheduled procedure before it is considered a different procedure, or how much must be performed before the procedure is considered complete.</p>

Beyond meeting the Final State requirements, accurately reflecting in the CANCELED UPS instance the actual state of the task (e.g., reflecting partial work completed and/or any cleanup performed during cancellation), is at the discretion of the performing system.</p>
