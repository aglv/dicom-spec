Some people utilize the DHCP database as a documentation tool for documenting the assignment of IP addresses that are preset on equipment. This does not interfere with DHCP operation and can make a gradual transition from equipment presets to DHCP assignments easier. It also helps avoid accidental re-use of IP addresses that are already manually assigned. However, DHCP does not verify that these entries are in fact correct.</p>

The unique name requirement is common to any LDAP database and not just to DICOM AE Titles.

The DHCP request can indicate a desired machine name that DHCP can associate with a configuration saved at the DHCP server. DHCP does not guarantee that the desired machine name will be granted because it might already be in use, but this mechanism is often used to maintain specific machine configurations. The DHCP will also update the DNS server (using the DDNS mechanisms) with the assigned IP address and hostname information. Legacy note: A machine with pre-configured IP addresses, DNS servers, and NTP servers may skip this step. As an operational and documentation convenience, the DHCP server database may contain the description of this pre-configured machine.</p>

During initial device installation it is likely that the LDAP database lacks information regarding the device. Using some vendor specific mechanism, e.g., service procedures, the device configuration is obtained. This device configuration includes all the information that will be stored in the LDAP database. The fields for "device name" and "AE Title" are tentative at this point.</p>

It is at this point that LDAP determines whether the AE Title is in fact unique among all AE Titles. If the title is unique, the creation succeeds. If there is a conflict, the creation fails and "name already in use" is given as a reasonless uses propose/create as an atomic operation for creating unique items. The LDAP approach permits unique titles that comply with algorithms for structured names, check digits, etc. DICOM does not require structured names, but they are a commonplace requirement for other LDAP users. It may take multiple attempts to find an unused name. This multiple probe behavior can be a problem if "unconfigured device" is a common occurrence and name collisions are common. Name collisions can be minimized at the expense of name structure by selecting names such as "AExxxxxxxxxxxxxx" where
                                "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" is a truly randomly selected number. The odds of collision are then exceedingly small, and a unique name will be found within one or two probes.</p>

This implies the use of a distributed or federated database. These have update propagation issues. There is not a requirement for a complete and accurate view of the DICOM network at all times. There is a requirement that local subsets of the network maintain an accurate local view. E.g., each hospital in a large hospital chain may tolerate occasional disconnections or problems in viewing the network information in other hospitals in that chain, but they require that their own internal network be reliably and accurately described.</p>
