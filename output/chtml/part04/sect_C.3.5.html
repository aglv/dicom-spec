                                        In special cases, such as where Bits Stored is less than Bits Allocated but varies per frame, it may be safe to use the largest value for all the frames and ensure that any unused high bits are appropriately masked before encoding.
                                        It is not expected that source images with different numbers of Rows and Columns will be combined (by padding the periphery of images smaller than the largest); quite apart from not being the intended use case, this has the potential to greatly expand the size of the instance, and might also require adjustment of the Image Position (Patient) values.
                                        If the value of Photometric Interpretation in the source single frame images is not permitted for the Enhanced Multi-frame image IOD, lossless conversion of the PixelData and updating of the related Attributes is required, e.g., from MONOCHROME1 to MONOCHROME2.</p>
