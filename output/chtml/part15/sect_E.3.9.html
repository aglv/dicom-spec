            <a id="para_c95beebc-f832-4187-8ef9-37bc061fa1c9" shape="rect"></a>Though individuals do not have unique identifiers themselves, studies, series, instances and other entities in the DICOM model are assigned globally unique UIDs. Whilst these UIDs cannot be mapped directly to an individual out of context, given access to the original images, or to a database of the original images containing the UIDs, it would be possible to recover the individual's identity.</p>

            <a id="para_36d80c44-a53c-40e3-aa86-773f5f3a6ddc" shape="rect"></a>However, there are applications that require the ability to maintain an audit trail back to the original images and though there are other mechanisms they may not scale well or be reliably implemented. This Option is provided for use when it is judged that the risk of gaining access to the original information via the UIDs is small relative to the benefit of retaining them.</p>

Specifically, the pixel data of the de-identified image can be matched against the pixel data of the original image. Such matching can be greatly accelerated by comparing pre-computed hash values of the pixel data. Removal of burned-in identification may change the pixel data but then matching against a sub-region of the pixel data is almost certainly possible (e.g., the central region of an image). Even addition of noise to an image is not sufficient to prevent re-identification since statistical matching techniques can be used. Ultimately, if any useable pixel data is retained during de-identification, then re-identification is nearly always possible if one has access to the original images. Ergo, replacement of UIDs
                                should not give rise to a false confidence that the images have been more thoroughly de-identified than if the UIDs are retained.</p>

E.g., one would never remove or replace the SOP Class UID for de-identification purposes.</p>

                                Hence if the original UIDs are not replaced, they may assist identity recovery.
                                That said, the presence of an apparent date/time stamp in a UID does not indicate that it is an original UID, since replacement UIDs may contain new date/time stamps related to when the instance was de-identified.
                                Also, UUIDs may be time-based rather than name-based or random-number-based,
                                so use of the <a href="../part05/sect_B.2.html" class="olink" shape="rect">PS3.5 Section B.2 UUID Derived UID</a> mechanism does not necessarily avoid this issue.</p>
