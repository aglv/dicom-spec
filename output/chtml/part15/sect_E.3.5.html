E.g., the description might contain "CT chest abdomen pelvis - 55F Dr. Smith".</p>

For example, in the string "CT chest abdomen pelvis - 55F Dr. Smith" are found in Study Description (0008,1030), then it would be feasible to detect and retain "CT chest abdomen pelvis" and discard the remainder. In an international setting, this may require an extensive dictionary of words that are safe to retain, e.g., to detect "Buik" for abdomen in Dutch or "λεκάνη" for pelvis in Greek. Another possibility is to extract such information and attempt to code the information in other Attributes (if otherwise absent or empty) such as Anatomic Region Sequence (0008,2218). However, the possibility of string values being both identifying and descriptive in different uses needs to be considered, e.g., "Dr. Hand" or "M. Genou".</p>

For example, all SH, LO, ST, LT and UT Value Representations could perhaps be misused. Code strings, CS, are not generally at risk, but a check against known Defined Terms and Enumerated Values could be performed. Though extremely unusual, it is conceivable that even a DS or IS string could be misused, and a check could be made that only legal numeric characters were used. Any PN Attribute is obviously at risk. The OB VR is discussed in the Retain Safe Private Option.</p>

Depending on the application, it may be desirable to retain some information, such as technique description, but discard other information, such as diagnosis, for example because it may bias the interpretation in a clinical trial. For example, one approach is to remove all description and comment Attributes except Series Description (0008,103E), since this Attribute rarely contains identifying or diagnosis information yet is typically a reliable source of useful information about the acquisition technique populated automatically from modality device protocols, though it still could be cleaned as described in Note 2.</p>

However, this is to some extent true also if the condition or other unusual physical features are obvious from visual examination of the images themselves. E.g., how many conjoined twins born in a particular month in Philadelphia might there be?</p>
