A Service Episode is the context in which the treatment or management of an arbitrary subset of a Patient's medical conditions occurs.

A Service Episode may involve one or more Healthcare Organizations (administrative entities that authorize Healthcare Providers to provide services within their legal administrative domain, e.g., hospitals, private physician's offices, multispecialty clinics, nursing homes).</p>

An instance of a Requested Procedure includes all of the items of information that are specified by an instance of a Procedure Plan that is selected for the Requested Procedure by the imaging service provider. This Procedure Plan is defined by the imaging service provider on the basis of the Procedure Plan templates associated with the considered Procedure Type. An Imaging Service Request may include requests for several different Requested Procedures. The purpose of this entity is to establish the association between Imaging Service Requests and Procedure Types, to convey the information that belongs to this association and to establish the relationships between Requested Procedures and the other entities that are needed to describe them. A single Requested Procedure of one Procedure Type is the smallest unit of service that can be
                        requested, reported, coded and billed. Performance of one instance of a Requested Procedure is specified by exactly one Procedure Plan. A Requested Procedure leads to one or more Scheduled Procedure Steps involving Protocols as specified by a Procedure Plan. A Requested Procedure may be associated with one or more Visits.

A Modality Scheduled Procedure Step involves equipment (e.g., imaging Modality equipment, anesthesia equipment, surgical equipment, transportation equipment), human resources, consumable supplies, location, and time (e.g., start time, stop time, duration). While in the context of imaging services the scheduling of a Modality Scheduled Procedure Step might include only a general designation of imaging Modality that could be satisfied by multiple pieces of the same equipment type, the performance of one instance of a Modality Scheduled Procedure Step involves one and only one piece of imaging Modality equipment.</p>

Each Scheduled Procedure Step is performed according to a single Protocol, which may be identified by one or more Protocol Codes and may be described in a Defined Procedure Protocol. The Protocols actually performed during a Procedure Step may be recorded in a Performed Procedure Protocol and may differ from those prescribed in the related Procedure Plan. Audit of actually performed Protocols versus the prescribed Procedure Plan is an important element of quality control.</p>

The Standard does not specify whether the production of these is a single unit of service, or two. A single Modality Performed Procedure Step Instance could list both the "for processing" images and the "for presentation" images, regardless of whether or not both sets of images were stored to the same or different AEs, or indeed were stored at all, since the MPPS is independent of the storage semantics. Alternatively, the modality may treat these two sets of images as two separate units of service, and send two separate MPPS Instances.</p>

When the reconstruction of both sets of images is prospectively defined and automatically initiated by the protocol selection, then both sets might be referenced from a single MPPS Instance. However, if the reconstruction of one or the other set is performed retrospectively by manual intervention some time after the acquisition MPPS had been completed, the subsequent Instances will necessarily be referenced in a new MPPS Instance, since the acquisition MPPS cannot be modified once completed.</p>

The "units of service" that the modality describes in an MPPS, and how the modality relates those Performed Procedure Steps to Scheduled Procedure Steps, are implementation decisions beyond the scope of the Standard.

For example, a modality may be capable of storing a CT acquisition as multiple single-frame CT Image Storage SOP Instances, as a single multi-frame Enhanced CT Image Storage SOP Instance, or as several Enhanced CT Image Storage SOP Instances that together comprise a Concatenation. An MPPS may describe all three possibilities, even though only one choice may ultimately be stored, perhaps depending on the negotiated capabilities of the storage recipient. Alternatively, separate MPPS Instances could be used for different storage SOP Classes.</p>
